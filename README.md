## 1. Prologue: The Fall of Civilization
The world fell into ruin after the Global Genetic War in the 22nd century. Humanity's obsession with biotechnology and genetic engineering unleashed uncontrollable forces, including dangerous mutations, biological weapons, and extreme climate changes. These disasters were triggered by GeneTech Corp, a global scientific organization that aimed to create solutions to save humanity but instead became the catalyst for global destruction.

## 2. XORA Island: A Haven of Hope and Danger
XORA Island, located in a remote ocean, was formerly the epicenter of advanced genetic experiments under the project known as EvoGenesis. This project aimed to create new beings that were stronger and more adaptive but ultimately failed, resulting in uncontrollable mutations. Now, the island serves as the last refuge for the Shiba, who strive to rebuild their civilization amidst the threats of roaming mutants and abandoned GeneTech technologies.

## 3. The Shiba: A New Evolution
The Shiba are the result of GeneTech's genetic experiments, designed as a new race that is smarter, stronger, and more adaptive than humans. After the world’s collapse, the Shiba fled to XORA Island and established their colony. With extraordinary intelligence and biotechnological capabilities, they utilize the island's resources to survive and battle the mutant threats that dominate the land.

## 4. Conflict and Challenges

### 4.1 The Threat of Mutants
Mutant creatures, born from failed experiments, continuously attack the Shiba colonies. These mutants evolve and grow stronger over time, posing a significant threat to the survival of the Shiba.
